## Overview
**WeatherFlow Mix** is a personalized discovery tool for Spotify users. Instead of repeating the same tracks, it explores the discography of artists you already love to find fresh tracks you might have missed.

> **Note**: Current version focuses on artist-based discovery. Weather-based curation is in development.

## Current Features
- **Smart Artist Mining**: Identifies artists from your **Top 50** recently played tracks.
- **Deep Discovery**: Scans for "Top Tracks" of those artists that you haven't listed in your Top 50.
- **Auto-Curation**: Shuffles and picks **30 fresh tracks** to keep your library exciting.
- **Seamless Sync**: Automatically updates your `WeatherFlow Mix` playlist on Spotify.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **API Library**: [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/)
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## Roadmap (Coming Soon)
- [ ] **Real-time Weather Integration**: Adjusting the playlist mood based on your local weather (Temperature, Precipitation, etc.).
- [ ] **Custom Limits**: Allow users to choose how many tracks to generate.
